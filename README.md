Contributors: please read LICENSE.md.  By contributing to this project you agree to grant the project owner a non-exclusive right to use your code in anyway they wish.

## Prereqquisite:
a. If you have never code with Node.js and React, you should do some tutorials first. There are plenty of free tutorials online, including https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html 
b. If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one on https://github.com/

## Setup: 
1. download & install Node.js, https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. download & install Visual Studio Code (or an editor of your choice), https://code.visualstudio.com/Download 
3. install Git, https://github.com/git-guides/install-git -- NOTE: the GitHub Desktop does not work within VS Code. Instead, I prefer to install Git on Windows (or your platform) and then install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension for VS Code, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github. Click on the Source Control icon and follow directions to login to GitHub, etc.
