By contributing to this project you agree to grant the project owner a non-exclusive right to use your code in anyway they wish.

If you don't already have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one. Then ask the project lead to add you to this project. If you don't already know git, please take a quick tutorial.

### Projects

1. client -- This is our main app for frontend (client) development. It is using react-native (for mobile app dev) but it can also generate a web app (with the react-native-web package).
2. web-app -- This is an optional project for anyone who just wants to focus on web development only. TBD is whether we'll keep these web and mobile app development separate or combine them in the future.
3. (coming soon) api -- The backend (server) project that will implement the business logic (including authentication, spam/solicitation checking, security, etc.) and read/write dynamic data from storage.

See the README.md file under each folder for that project's instructions.

### Making code changes:

Please review the Issues list and check with the project lead before taking on issue(s).

1. Create a branch. The branch name should reflect the task/issue(s). Or you can use your name (or your username/alias) if you prefer to make it your work branch / sandbox.
2. Checkout that branch, do some coding, test it and commit your changes to that branch. You can do multiple commits.
3. When ready, push your changes up to GitHub and then create a pull request.
4. After code review, if the pull request is approved then it will be merged into the MAIN branch.
