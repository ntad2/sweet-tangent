# Sweet Tangent

## Client App (mobile, tablet and web)

### Preregquisite:

1. If you have never code with Node.js and React, you should do some tutorials first. There are plenty of free tutorials online. My recommendations:
   - React Tutorial for Beginners: https://youtu.be/Ke90Tje7VS0
   - React Native Tutorial for Beginners: https://youtu.be/0-S5a0eXPoc

### Setup:

1. download & install Node.js, https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. download & install Visual Studio Code (or an editor of your choice), https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. install Git, https://github.com/git-guides/install-git -- NOTE: the GitHub Desktop does not work within VS Code. Instead, I prefer to install Git on Windows (or your platform) and then install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension for VS Code, https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github. Click on the Source Control icon and follow directions to login to GitHub, etc.
4. create a project folder, cd into it and get the code: $ git clone https://github.com/ntad2/sweet-tangent.git
   NOTE: there will be multiple folders/projects.

### The Client App:

1. $ cd client
2. install dependencies: $ npm install
3. compile & run: $ npm start
   - the Metro Bundler will open up in your web browser
   - click on the "Run in web browser" link, wait for it, the web app will appear
   - see below for Android and iOS
4. use Ctrl-C to stop
